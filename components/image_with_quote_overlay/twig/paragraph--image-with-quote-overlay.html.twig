    Extends 'paragraph.html.twig' following the rules of theme inheritance, see
    https://www.drupal.org/node/2387069 for details

    Only applies to paragraphs with the name image_with_quote_overlay

    Instead of naming paragraphs with that name, consider 'include'
    ex. {% include directory ~ '/templates/paragraph--image-with-quote-overlay.html.twig' %}
    in the template file appropriate for your custom paragraph type
#}

{% extends "paragraph.html.twig" %}
{% set attributes = attributes.addClass('image-with-quote-overlay') %}
